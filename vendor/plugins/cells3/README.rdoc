= Cells3 - Cells port for Rails 3.0

Just as Rails 3.0 current Cells version is under heavy development so use it only if you're curious about progress.

Didn't you hear about cells? Check it here http://cells.rubyforge.org

== Working app setup

  Go to http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/5/rails-3-0-beta-release and follow the instruction to install rails3
  rails cells_rails3
  script/rails plugin install git://github.com/mlomnicki/cells3.git
  # create view and some cells
  script/rails server

Check <tt>localhost:3000</tt> - it is powered by Rails 3.0 and Cells 3.0 now.

== What will be done?

* Build Cells on top of AbstractController.
  * Thanks that adding features like helpers, callbacks, caching will be as simple as including a module.

* Make cells strongly configurable
  * So you can use only these features you really need letting cells be as lightweight as possible.

* Agnosticism - bring it from Rails 3.0 core
  * Ie. you don't have to use ERB as template engine. Just choose your favourite.

* Code cleanup 
  * Use ready rails modules to not reinvent the wheel  

* New render API
  * more or less described in thread http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/cells-talk/2009-November/000155.html

* Backward compatibility
  * Try save as much as possible compatibility with Cells 2.3.

* Performance
  * Try to improve (good anyway) performance. Provide appropriate tests.

* Ruby 1.9 compatibility
  * After all cells should be compatible with ruby 1.8 as well as 1.9

== What is done?

* Support for filters
* Rails 3.0 generators
* Cell::Base inherits from AbstractController. Unneeded methods removed from Cell::Base
* Don't need to mess up in ActionView::Base to render partial
* Rendering done via AbstractController::Rendering
* Helpers available via AbstractController::Helpers
* Views inheritance is done without need to catch exceptions
* Introduced Cell::Initializer. Choose which features you would like to use.

== What is broken?

* Backward compatitbility: 
  * parent controller accessible as #parent_controller, not #controller as always
  * returning string from cell state doesn't render it. Need explicity render :text => 'foobar'

== Motivation

Few talks with Nick Sutterer at RuPy 2009 and in some Polish pubs ;)

== Old README

Available in README (without rdoc extension)
